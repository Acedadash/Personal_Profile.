    Goals

<p>My goal is to be a succesful man in the future but without moving forward or taking actions, me or I wont reach my goal.</p>
<p>In order for me to reach my goal, I first need to prioritize my schooling and focus on helping my parents.</p>
<p>For me its very crucial to learn especially from your mistake, and also experiences can change your life. </p><p>For instance, your an adict person from smoking but then something bad happened to your health. You start to feel sluggish, and hard beathing and you went to hospital and the doctor says to stop smoking for better health and to avoid these health issues </p>
<p>Now you know smoking is not a good habit, it causes you bad effects on health which can lead to death. Now do you think you should continue smoking, of cource not unless you want to die..  </p>
